Next.js is installed but the app is decribed as a SPA with setCurrentPage for navigation.

ColorPick.test.tsx/
- Test description says "button", but looks for role "link". Test and description should match.

MainContent.test.tsx/ & Header.test.tsx/
- It was unclear which heading should be h1, since both the header and MainContent are described as headings without levels. Usually, the h1 is placed in the header, so I put it there. Since the subsections are under the main heading in MainContent, they should use h3 instead of h2.

Header.test.tsx/
- The Header tests repeatedly render the same component. Using beforeEach can reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
